# Termtodo

Terminal todo tool.

## Install

`go install github.com/sshelll/termtodo@latest`

## Run

run `termtodo` if GOPATH was configured  
or `$GOPATH/bin/termtodo` instead.

## Attention

The default persistent file path is `~/.local/termtodo/todo.yml`

And you can set `TERMTODO_PERSIST_FILE` env as your customized persistent file path.

Thers's a hack usage of this env key,
such as you can set a file path which is in a `icloud` or `onedrive` directory,
and then you can make it sync. ðŸ˜„
